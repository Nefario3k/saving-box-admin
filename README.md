# Saving Box Admin
A content management system for the savings box user system. A fullly responsive administration dashboard to manage all content and help users on the savings box user end. This template design was created for and to manage resources designated for a monetary system, manage users and provide adequate support. As this is an administration content management system, animation is reduced to a bare minimum, save for certain reusable components.

### What I learned

As a process of documenting progress, i include this sectiion in my projects. I learned proper use of creating reusable components, outlining a project beore start and determinig reusable component to create and pass arbitrary values to in oreder to reuse the component using those values. Along side other cms i built, i also learned how to create responsive UI taking into account functionality when backend implementation commences after UI completion. I also learned how to manage the UX when it came to adding functionality and inplementing api's.

### Continued development

Since this is an administration webapp, the animation is reduced to only the reusable components when entering the dom. I look forward to learning miore animation styles to create much more modern and more interactive webapp.
